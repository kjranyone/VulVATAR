//! Pose-calibration fullscreen modal.
//!
//! State machine: `Closed → Idle → WaitingForPose → Collecting →
//! AnchorDone → (RangeHoldStill → RangeCollecting →)? Done → Closed`.
//! See `state.rs` for the variant-by-variant contract.
//!
//! Per-frame samples are accumulated from the source-skeleton mailbox
//! during the `Collecting` window, the per-axis **median** + per-frame
//! **stddev** are computed on transition to `Done`, and the resulting
//! [`crate::tracking::PoseCalibration`] is written into
//! `Application::tracking_calibration.pose` so persistence (auto-save
//! + project file) picks it up on the next round-trip.
//!
//! The capture rejects low-quality frames at intake — anchor must be
//! detected, the anchor type must match the chosen mode, and the
//! source-skeleton overall confidence must clear `MIN_FRAME_CONF`.
//! "Capture Now" finishes early but still requires `MIN_SAMPLES`
//! gathered samples to avoid writing a 1-frame "calibration" that's
//! no better than the auto-EMA's first frame.
//!
//! The modal is a true overlay: a dimmed full-viewport rect underneath
//! a centred `egui::Window` so all background interaction (orbit
//! controls, inspector clicks) is blocked while calibration is active.
//!
//! Module layout:
//! - [`state`]       — state-machine enum, sample types, simple impls.
//! - [`pose_match`]  — live pose vs. target-pose scoring (drives the
//!   `WaitingForPose → Collecting` gate).
//! - [`transitions`] — state-graph edges (begin / finish / retry /
//!   skip / range / time-driven advance).
//! - [`finalize`]    — sample aggregation + writing the resulting
//!   [`PoseCalibration`] into Application + active profile + mailbox.
//! - [`refresh`]     — per-frame mailbox snapshot fold-in (anchor
//!   visibility, confidence, pose-match score, sample collection).
//! - [`panes`]       — egui rendering, public `draw_modal` entry
//!   point. The other modules are pure logic; this is the only module
//!   that knows about `egui` types.
